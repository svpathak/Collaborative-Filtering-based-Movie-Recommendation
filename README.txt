For evaluation metrics, we had to use 3 extra libraries:
1. 	pip3 install surprise
2. 	pip3 install scikit-surprise
3. 	pip3 install recmetrics

***Important***
***IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO RUN THIS CODE ON LINUX MACHINE as "surprise" needs extra visual c++ dependencies while installing in windows.***
